## How to build and test CKAN

In this repository, CKAN and its related tools are redistributed as a set of Docker containers interacting with one each other.

The tools needed to build the `CKAN container` and a working local test environment are provided in the `docker` folder of this repository. The commands below should be run from such folder.

Build the local test environment (build the CKAN container and download dependencies)

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Load "ckan vocabulary" in ckan container:

```shell
docker exec -it ckandcat /bin/bash -c ./ckan-vocabulary.sh
```

Access ckan server with browser at this link `http://localhost:5000`

The following default credentials can be used to access the portal

```
User: ckanadmin
Password: ckanpassword
```

> NOTE: Credentials should be changed after the first login.

## How to contribute

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open issues and submit a pull request at any time!

This is a temporary repository, still maintained because consumed by the production DAF environment. Anyway, an ongoing development work is moving on [here](https://github.com/italia/dati-ckan-docker).

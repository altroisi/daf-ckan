## How to build and test CKAN

In this repository, CKAN and its related tools are redistributed as a set of Docker containers interacting with one each other.

The `dockerfile` and the `docker-compose.yaml` files are in the root of this repository.

To build the local test environment (build the CKAN container and download dependencies) run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

>NOTE: the `docker-compose.yaml` file sets different environment variables that could be used to adapt and customized many platform functionalities.

Then, access the CKAN GUI in a browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

The following default credentials can be used to access the portal

```
Username: ckanadmin
Password: ckanpassword
```

> NOTE: Credentials should be changed after the first login.

To bring down the test environment and remove the containers use

```shell
docker-compose down
```
